# Something about me
Well, my name is **Monthly Away**, which is random name *Chrome* generated for me. I major in Artificial Intelligence, but my class schedule now has nothing to do with that. I spend almost 90% of my time on Mathematical Analysis, which i believe will be of little use in real life.
